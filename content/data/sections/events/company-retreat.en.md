In order to develop as a company, it is sometimes necessary to sit together and spend time outside the regular working environment.

So we rented a simple scout hostel near Winterthur and built a fire, cooked, ate and played together.

But most importantly, we discussed topics around openscript and how we envision the future of the company.
