title: What is currently the best Javascript framework?

I currently like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) very much, however we use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as the basis for this website because it fits better for this purpose. In my opinion, the question has to be answered differently depending on the project or use-case.
