title: What is your favorite ruby gem?
answeredBy: Diego Steiner

There are many great gems out there that are developed and maintained by the open source community. [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) is the gem that I find myself using in almost every project, but I also really like [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) and [Statesman](https://github.com/gocardless/statesman).
