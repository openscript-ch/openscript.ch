  Although the idea and name had existed for some time before, the company was officially founded by Robin in January 2020. Shortly after the founding, Diego joined as the second co-founder. From then on, the two worked together to implement the first software projects.

  At first, we thought we would simply work from home. But when we learned that the former Swissôtel in Oerlikon was being converted into shared accommodation for students and startups, we applied immediately and were lucky. The story can be read [here](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/mit-rund-300-mitbewohnern-dieser-ehemalige-hotelturm-wird-zur-mega-wg). Thus, we had our first office in the heart of Oerlikon from February 2021 until the end of the year.

  In doing so, we realized that it helps us greatly when we can exchange ideas in person regularly. Therefore, we decided to rent an office even after the interim use of the Swissôtel. We quickly found a suitable office in Glattbrugg, which we have been using since early 2022.

  In the meantime, additional employees have joined us, supporting us in the implementation of our projects.

  Since then, we have continuously evolved and realized new projects that support our vision and mission. We look forward to the upcoming challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
